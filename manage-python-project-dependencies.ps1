# manage-python-project-dependencies.ps1
#
# PowerShell version of manage-python-project-dependencies.sh
# This script automates the setup and interactive use of a Dockerized Python dependency management environment.
# Usage: .\manage-python-project-dependencies.ps1 [-InitialRun]
#
# - Checks Docker installation and availability
# - Builds the dev Docker image (if needed)
# - Runs the setup script to generate poetry.lock and pdm.lock
# - Drops the user into an interactive shell with Poetry and PDM ready to use (default)
# - OR runs initial setup non-interactively with pdm install (initial-run parameter)
# - All changes persist in your project directory
